# Take home message     

We examined the beliefs and feelings toward **Joel Le Forestier**. 
<br><br>
According to the `r nrow(dataset)` affiliates of Joel:
- Joel's level of amazingness and wonderfulness can neither be fully described in words nor measured with a 6-point Likert scale  
- Joel must learn to be fluent in Italian with a Sicilian accent  
- Joel is most likely to appear as a character in a dark comedy book 
- Joel is like the Fall and unlike the Winter  
- Joel's wise nature can be explained by his immortality and his 150 years on the earth   
- Joel's chances of winning a battle of wits against a goose is inconclusive until more information about the goose is made available
